This film surprised me in a good way. The trailers did not do justice to the actual movie. It was emotional, thrilling, and had moments of pure brilliance. The performances were heartfelt, especially the lead actor who delivered an outstanding performance. The direction was sharp, and the narrative kept me engaged. Visual effects were used smartly without overdoing it. It left me thinking about the story long after it ended. Definitely a hidden gem worth watching!
