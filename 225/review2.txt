I found the movie to be quite disappointing. The plot was predictable and lacked originality. Though the actors tried their best, the script failed to support them. Some scenes dragged on unnecessarily, and the editing could have been tighter. I felt disconnected from the characters and their journeys. The music was decent, but nothing memorable. It seemed like the film had potential but was not executed well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch.
