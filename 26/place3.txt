The Great Wall of China is a marvel of ancient engineering. It stretches over 13,000 miles across mountains, deserts, and plains. Built to protect Chinese kingdoms from invasions, the wall tells stories of history, culture, and perseverance. Some sections are fully restored, while others have been reclaimed by nature. Visitors can walk along various parts of the wall, such as Badaling and Mutianyu. The panoramic views from the top are breathtaking. It is a symbol of China's rich history and is one of the most visited tourist attractions globally.
